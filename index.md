Simple Template project aims at making very minimal templates for commonly used
static site generators, which keeps the focus on actual content rather then
graphics and transitions. Therefore, the templates don’t use any *CSS* or
*Javascript* framework to make it look good or responsive, instead templates
are designed using the fact that raw *HTML* is already pretty responsive. Also,
to avoid additional requests to the web server, the *CSS* is embedded in *HTML*
itself. And absolutely no *Javascript* is used. The result is very fast and
responsive templates which can be viewed on any browser CLI based or otherwise
from any device at all which supports internet. And therefore Simple Templates
are proud member of [Viewable With Any
Browser](https://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/) campaign.

Simple Template is inspired by [Eric S. Raymond](https://goo.gl/DHVBGV)’s [HTML
Hell](https://goo.gl/G6GWhT) page and [txti](https://goo.gl/ioSQF4) by [Barry
T. Smith](https://goo.gl/2869og).

Following is the list of Static Site Generators, for which a template is ready
to be used by users and the link corresponds to that particular template’s
demonstration website.
